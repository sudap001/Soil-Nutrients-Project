**Soil Nutrients and Crop Detection Management System Using IoT June 2021**

**Stack/Tools:** *IoT, TCS3200 Colour Sensor, pH Electrode, Rain Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Node MCU, Teamspeak, python,
Python libraries.*

* Integrated multiple sensors (soil moisture, pH, rain, humidity) using NodeMCU for real-time agricultural monitoring.
  
* Collected GPS-tagged environmental data and fetched weather info for geospatial field tracking.

* Developed a Python backend for sensor data analysis to determine optimal crop recommendations.

* Built a dashboard for farmers to view soil health and crop suggestions via sensor thresholdsâ€”improving yield planning
